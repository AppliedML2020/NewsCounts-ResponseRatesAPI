# NewsCounts 2020 Census response rates API

In NewsCounts we built an API on top of the Census Bureau API to makes it easier to retrieve response rates data from the 2020 Census. The documentation of this API can be found here: https://bernacho.github.io/NewsCounts-ResponseRatesAPI/API_documentation.html

Using this new API we created an interactive [dashboard](https://newscounts.appspot.com/) that creates tables and time series plots for response rates at state, county or tract level. This intuitive tool also allows the user to easily download data as a CSV file.
